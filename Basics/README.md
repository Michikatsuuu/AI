This repository is a collection of simple machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. It serves as a playground for experimenting with various algorithms and understanding their behavior. Currently, it includes implementations of a Genetic algorithm, Backpropagation,Hopfield neural network, and a Simple_Delta_rule.

For example: How to run a Genetic Algorithm and what is it?

1.The genetic algorithm (GA) is a heuristic search and optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. It is commonly used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.

2.How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x).

3.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Michikatsuuu/AI/blob/main/Basics/Genetic_Algorithm.py

4.Navigate to the repository:
cd machine-learning-algorithms

5.Run the genetic algorithm script:
python genetic_algorithm.py

6.Follow on-screen prompts to input parameters, do the same to all others programs, and observe the algorithm's behavior.
